# Post-Merge Validation Issue Template

## Issue Summary
Address improvements and validation tasks related to the merge of Issue #2 (`üèóÔ∏è Implement GitHub Copilot-driven automated repository structure workflow`).

## Background
- **Original Issue**: #2 - GitHub Copilot-driven automated repository structure workflow
- **Merged Branch**: `copilot/fix-71a13388-9183-473b-a4d1-dadd0595d643`
- **Target Branch**: `main`
- **Merge Status**: ‚úÖ Completed on 2025-07-05T14:13:43Z

## Tasks to Complete

### üîç Merge Integration Validation
- [ ] Verify correct integration into main branch
- [ ] Confirm repository structure is intact
- [ ] Validate merge commit exists in history
- [ ] Ensure no merge conflicts remain

### üßπ Branch Cleanup
- [ ] **Critical**: Verify branch `copilot/fix-71a13388-9183-473b-a4d1-dadd0595d643` is deleted locally
- [ ] **Critical**: Verify branch `copilot/fix-71a13388-9183-473b-a4d1-dadd0595d643` is deleted from remote
- [ ] Audit other stale copilot branches for cleanup
- [ ] Document cleanup procedures

### üîß Residual Issues Check
- [ ] Scan for merge conflict markers in codebase
- [ ] Remove any temporary merge files
- [ ] Verify working tree is clean
- [ ] Check file permissions on scripts

### üìã Validation Tools
- [ ] **Implemented**: Automated post-merge validation script
- [ ] **Implemented**: Comprehensive validation documentation
- [ ] Test validation script functionality
- [ ] Update documentation based on findings

## Validation Resources

### Automated Validation
Execute the post-merge validation script:
```bash
./scripts/post-merge-validation.sh
```

### Documentation
- **Validation Guide**: `docs/post-merge-validation.md`
- **Validation Script**: `scripts/post-merge-validation.sh`

### Manual Checks
If automated validation fails, perform manual verification:
```bash
# Check branch status
git branch -a
git ls-remote --heads origin

# Verify merge history
git log --oneline --grep="pull request #2"

# Check for residual issues
git status --porcelain
find . -name "*.orig" -o -name "*.rej"
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All validation checks pass
- [ ] Branch `copilot/fix-71a13388-9183-473b-a4d1-dadd0595d643` is completely removed
- [ ] No residual merge artifacts exist
- [ ] Repository structure is intact and functional
- [ ] Documentation is updated and accurate

## Notes
- The validation script handles shallow clones gracefully
- Remote branch cleanup may require elevated permissions
- Some validation warnings are expected in development environments

## Priority
**High** - Post-merge validation is critical for repository health and should be completed promptly.

## Labels
- `maintenance`
- `post-merge`
- `validation`
- `cleanup`
